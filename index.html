                        mason jars which kids can weigh on mass scales to guess density. They will then mix the liquids
                        and see how the differences in densities will cause the liquids to separate. Participants will
                        then use a pH indicator solution as a pH indicator to guess the "order" of pH of the liquid
                        using a color chart. These answers will then be verified using an Endress + Hauser pH probe by
                        dipping it into the liquid. </p>
